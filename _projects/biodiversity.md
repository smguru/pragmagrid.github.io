One of the ongoing activities of the PRAGMA is fostering virtual biodiversity expeditions 
by bringing domain scientists and cyber infrastructure specialists together as a team.  Over
the past few years, PRAGMA members have been collaborating on virtualizing the Lifemapper
software infrastructure.  Virtualization and cloud computing have increased scalability,
flexibility, efficiency and simplified application deployment on the PRAGMA cloud.

Lifemapper is a complex biological software infrastructure developed by the 
Biodiversity Institute at The University of Kansas.  It creates and maintains an archive
of species distribution maps calculated from public specimen distribution maps calculated from 
public specimen data and includes a suite of data and tools for biodiversity researchers that
calculate single and multi-species distribution predictions and macroecological analyses.


#### Technical Goals:

* Create a viable virtualization solution that can be easily adopted and reused
by scientists at multiple institutions and projects.  This solution:

  * allows fast deployment of ready-made cluster images;
  * reproduces the complete Lifemapper processing pipeline at different sites and
  hosting environments;
  * enables scientists to perform Lifemapper-facilitated data processing on large,
  sensitive or restricted data.

#### Additional Goals:

* To create a viable virtualization solution that can be easily adopted and reused
by scientists at other institutions and projects.

* Garner uses (institutional and individual) to use these tools to create and work
with their own specialized Lifemapper instance.
