PRAGMA 33 attendees are welcome to submit posters (and associated abstracts)
to the PRAGMA 33 Poster Session.  
The poster session offers the opportunity for presenters to share their work
through a quick introduction to the entire conference audience, followed by
one-on-one discussions next to the poster.

## Submissions
Authors are expected to both present their poster during poster sessions and
to give a three (3) minute introductory lightning talk. As such, an acceptable
submission must include a PDF of the poster text abstract. The abstract will
form the basis for your lightning talk and should be up to 450 words -
covering the following information:  

1.  Title of the poster 
2.  Author names and institutions 
3.  Summary of work to be presented  

<br />
All posters must use the **A1** format (594 x 841 mm/23.4 x 33.1 in)
All submissions will be reviewed by PRAGMA Students Steering Committee and
decisions will be made available via email. Authors are expected to respond to
review comments and, if necessary, resubmit their updated poster and abstract.
