---

PRAGMA 32 attendees are welcome to submit posters (and associated abstracts) to the PRAGMA 32 Poster Session.  
The poster session offers the opportunity for presenters to share their work through a quick introduction to the entire conference audience, followed by one-on-one discussions next to the poster.

## Submissions
Authors are expected to both present their poster during poster sessions and to give a three (3) minute introductory lightning talk. As such, an acceptable submission must include a PDF of the poster text abstract. The abstract will form the basis for your lightning talk and should be up to 450 words - covering the following information:  

1.  Title of the poster 
1.  Author names and institutions 
1.  Summary of work to be presented  

<br />
All posters must use the **A1** format (594 x 841 mm/23.4 x 33.1 in)
All submissions will be reviewed by PRAGMA Students Steering Committee and decisions will be made available via email. Authors are expected to respond to review comments and, if necessary, resubmit their updated poster and abstract.

[Registration](http://www.pragma-grid.net/pragma32-registration/) for the main PRAGMA 32 event is required prior to abstract submission. 

## On-site Printing
